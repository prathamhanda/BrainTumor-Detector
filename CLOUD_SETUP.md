# üöÄ Cloud Setup Guide for Brain Tumor AI Classifier

This guide will help you upload your AI models to cloud storage and configure the app for full functionality on Streamlit Cloud.

## üìã Overview

Your app has three model files that need to be accessible for download:
- `model_38` (Classification model)
- `yolo_best.pt` (YOLO detection model) 
- `sam2_b.pt` (SAM segmentation model)

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Storage Options

### Option 1: Google Drive (Recommended)
**Pros**: Free, reliable, easy to use
**Cons**: Has download limits for popular files

1. **Upload Files**:
   - Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)
   - Create a new folder called "BrainTumor-AI-Models"
   - Upload your three model files

2. **Get Shareable Links**:
   - Right-click each file ‚Üí "Get link"
   - Change permission to "Anyone with the link can view"
   - Copy the sharing URL

3. **Convert to Direct Download Links**:
   ```
   From: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ABC123XYZ/view?usp=sharing
   To:   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1ABC123XYZ
   ```

### Option 2: Dropbox
**Pros**: Reliable, good for large files
**Cons**: Limited free storage

1. Upload files to Dropbox
2. Get shareable link for each file
3. Change `?dl=0` to `?dl=1` at the end of each URL

### Option 3: Hugging Face Hub (Recommended for ML models)
**Pros**: Designed for ML models, free, fast
**Cons**: Requires account setup

1. Create account at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co)
2. Create a new model repository
3. Upload your models using git or web interface
4. Use direct file URLs

### Option 4: AWS S3 / Other Cloud Services
**Pros**: Professional, scalable
**Cons**: May have costs, requires setup

## üîß Configuration Steps

1. **Choose a cloud storage option** from above
2. **Upload your model files** to the chosen service
3. **Get the direct download URLs** for each file
4. **Update `download_models.py`**:

```python
model_urls = {
    "model_38": "YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_DRIVE_LINK",
    "yolo_best.pt": "YOUR_ACTUAL_DROPBOX_LINK", 
    "sam2_b.pt": "YOUR_ACTUAL_HUGGINGFACE_LINK"
}
```

## üìù Example URLs

### Google Drive Example:
```python
"model_38": "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1ABC123XYZ456"
```

### Dropbox Example:
```python
"yolo_best.pt": "https://www.dropbox.com/s/abc123xyz/yolo_best.pt?dl=1"
```

### Hugging Face Example:
```python
"sam2_b.pt": "https://huggingface.co/yourusername/brain-tumor-models/resolve/main/sam2_b.pt"
```

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

1. **Local Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Temporarily move models folder
   mv models models_backup
   
   # Run app and test download
   streamlit run app.py
   
   # Restore models if needed
   mv models_backup models
   ```

2. **Cloud Testing**:
   - Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
   - Try the "Download AI Models" button
   - Verify all three models download successfully

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Download Fails
- Check if URLs are publicly accessible
- Verify file permissions (should be public/anyone with link)
- Test URLs in browser first

### Google Drive Rate Limits
- If you get rate limit errors, try:
  - Using Hugging Face instead
  - Creating multiple backup links
  - Adding retry logic

### Large File Issues
- Ensure stable internet connection
- Consider splitting very large files
- Use cloud services designed for large files

## üöÄ Quick Start (Google Drive)

1. **Upload to Google Drive**:
   - Upload `model_38`, `yolo_best.pt`, `sam2_b.pt`

2. **Get File IDs**:
   - Right-click ‚Üí Get link ‚Üí Copy
   - Extract file ID from URL

3. **Update URLs**:
   ```python
   model_urls = {
       "model_38": "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YOUR_MODEL_38_ID",
       "yolo_best.pt": "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YOUR_YOLO_ID",
       "sam2_b.pt": "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YOUR_SAM_ID"
   }
   ```

4. **Test & Deploy**! üéâ

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Keep backup links**: Store URLs in multiple places
- **Monitor usage**: Some services have download limits
- **Consider CDN**: For high-traffic apps, use a CDN
- **Version control**: Keep track of model versions
- **Security**: Don't commit actual URLs to public repos (use secrets)
