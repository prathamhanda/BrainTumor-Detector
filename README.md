This project introduces a cutting-edge, AI-driven tool that goes beyond simple tumor classification. Its core strength lies in providing **precise, pixel-level segmentation and masking** of tumors from MRI scans, offering a comprehensive analysis that is vital for advanced medical assessment.

## üöÄ Live Demo

**[Try the live app on Streamlit Cloud](https://brtumor.streamlit.app)**

*Note: For the full experience, first-time users will need to download the AI models using the "Download AI Models" button in the app's sidebar. This is a one-time setup.*

## üéØ Our Unique Selling Proposition: Precise Segmentation

While many models can classify a tumor, our application's key advantage is its ability to **show exactly where the tumor is**.

-   **Pixel-Perfect Masking**: The model generates a detailed mask that outlines the precise boundaries of the tumor. This is a significant step up from a simple bounding box.
-   **Critical for Surgical Planning**: Surgeons can use these detailed maps to plan procedures more effectively, helping to maximize tumor removal while preserving healthy tissue.
-   **Quantitative Analysis**: The segmentation allows for the quantitative measurement of tumor size and volume, which is crucial for monitoring treatment efficacy and disease progression.

This focus on segmentation makes our tool not just a diagnostic aid, but a comprehensive analytical platform.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Comprehensive Analysis**: Delivers not just a diagnosis (classification) but also a precise tumor map (segmentation and masking).
-   **Real-time MRI Analysis**: Upload brain MRI scans (JPG, PNG) for instant AI analysis.
-   **Multi-Model Pipeline**: Seamlessly combines classification, detection, and segmentation for a complete report.
-   **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with an intuitive Streamlit frontend for ease of use.
-   **High Accuracy**: Achieves 99.3% classification accuracy and advanced segmentation capabilities.

## üîß How It Works: The Technology Stack

The application employs a three-stage pipeline to analyze MRI images:

1.  **Classification (Custom ResNet)**: First, the image is classified to determine if a tumor is present and its type (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary).
2.  **Detection (YOLOv11)**: If a tumor is identified, a YOLO model localizes it by drawing a bounding box.
3.  **Segmentation (SAM2)**: This is our USP. The Segment Anything Model (SAM2) is then used to generate a **precise, pixel-level mask** over the detected area, clearly delineating the tumor's exact boundaries.

- **Backend**: PyTorch, OpenCV, PIL
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Model Distribution**: Cloud storage integration for seamless model access.
