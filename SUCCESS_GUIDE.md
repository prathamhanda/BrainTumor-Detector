## üîß TO UNLOCK FULL AI FEATURES (Next Steps)

### Step 1: Upload Models to Cloud Storage

Choose one of these options:

#### Option A: Google Drive (Recommended)
1. Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)
2. Create folder "BrainTumor-AI-Models"
3. Upload these files from your `models/` folder:
   - `model_38`
   - `yolo_best.pt` 
   - `sam2_b.pt`
4. For each file: Right-click ‚Üí Get link ‚Üí "Anyone with link can view"
5. Convert sharing URLs to direct download format:
   ```
   From: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ABC123XYZ/view?usp=sharing
   To:   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1ABC123XYZ
   ```

#### Option B: Dropbox
1. Upload files to Dropbox
2. Get shareable links
3. Change `?dl=0` to `?dl=1` at end of URLs

#### Option C: Hugging Face (Best for ML models)
1. Create account at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co)
2. Create model repository
3. Upload files via web interface

### Step 2: Update Download URLs

Edit `download_models.py` and replace placeholder URLs:

```python
model_urls = {
    "model_38": "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YOUR_MODEL_38_ID",
    "yolo_best.pt": "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YOUR_YOLO_ID", 
    "sam2_b.pt": "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YOUR_SAM_ID"
}
```

### Step 3: Test Locally

```bash
# Test the download feature
python test_ai_features.py

# Test the full app
streamlit run app.py
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Production

```bash
# Check deployment readiness
python deployment_checker.py

# Commit and push changes
git add .
git commit -m "Configure model download URLs"
git push origin master
```

### Step 5: Deploy on Streamlit Cloud

1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Deploy from your repository
4. Users can now download models directly in the app!
